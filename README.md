# Cloud-Room-Population-Counter
The goal of this project is to automatically upload data, such as the number of individuals in a given room at any given time, as well as the time, date, location, and photo IDs of anybody who enters or exits that area, to a cloud server where the host can keep track of everything in real time graphically.
